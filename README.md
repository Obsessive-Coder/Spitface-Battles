# Spitface-Battles

## **[Live Preview (bugs exist)](http://www.spitfacebattles.com)**
This project has recently moved to a private repository. Code examples are available upon request by emailing Jared Huffstutler at jaredhuff85@gmail.com.

Spitface Battles is a platform for fans of the underground hip-hop community. Users can challenge other users to rap battles, have their verse liked, dissed, and even scored by their peers. The site handles battle progression and rules so the users can focus on interacting and competing with each other.

More than a video platform or social media site, Spitface Battles aims to connect people through features that support the structure, flow, and rules of a rap battle while encouraging engagement through a handful of tools built specifically for this niche community.

Spitface Battles uses ReactJs, and accesses a Node and ExpressJS API that is hosted on AWS Elastic Beanstalk. Database manipulation is handled with Sequelize, and the database is being hosted on AWS Relational Database Service. Authentication is being managed with Auth0
